0. Have webtech-env activated
1. Use 'python flask_app.py' to start the app on port 5000
2. Go to url 'localhost:5000' (or subpages)

Note: Once the server is running, since it's in debug mode for now, it'll listen to change in files.
So if you modify any python / html / js / css / ..., you can just reload the page in your browser,
without restarting the server, to see your changes. Of course, if, after change in any python,
there are errors, the server will crash and you have to start it again.
