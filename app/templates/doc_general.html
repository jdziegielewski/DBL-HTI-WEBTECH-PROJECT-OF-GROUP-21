    This tool was created as part of a Design-Based Learning course at the TU/e.</br>
    The group was formed semi-randomly based on programming grades of another course, so that all members could contribute.</br>
    Over the course of nine weeks, the group developed this tool using the SCRUM method of cooperation.</br>
